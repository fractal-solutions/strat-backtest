# The Strat: mechanical implementation rules

The Strat is a discretionary framework, not a fully specified algorithm. This
document defines the exact subset implemented here. It is not a claim to
replicate every trader's Strat execution.

## 1. Candle classification

Compare current bar `C` to the previous bar `P` using high/low only:

| Type | Condition |
|---|---|
| `3` (outside) | `C.high > P.high` and `C.low < P.low` |
| `2U` (up) | `C.high > P.high` and `C.low >= P.low` |
| `2D` (down) | `C.high <= P.high` and `C.low < P.low` |
| `1` (inside) | otherwise (both sides contained/equal) |

Equality is handled as shown, matching the Alaric glossary's inclusive inside
bar definition. All signals use completed bars only.

## 2. Setups and triggers

After a completed setup bar `s`, the next bar can trigger a breakout of
`s.high` (long) or `s.low` (short). Stop is the opposite side of `s`.

| Setup label | Setup bar context | Canonical pattern it approximates |
|---|---|---|
| `2-1` | `1` after `2U/2D` | 2-1-2 |
| `3-1` | `1` after `3` | 3-1-2 |
| `1-2` | `2U/2D` after `1` | 1-2-2 |
| `2-2` | `2U/2D` after `2U/2D` | 2-2 continuation/reversal |
| `3-2` | `2U/2D` after `3` | 3-2 |
| `1-1` | `1` after `1` | compression (not canonical) |
| `3` | any bar after `3` | 3-bar breakout |
| `2` | any bar after `2` | 2-bar breakout |

Default: `2-1,3-1,1-2,2-2,3-2`.

The trigger bar's final type is not required at entry; the breakout itself is
the trigger. This is how a stop/breakout order is placed after the setup bar.

## 3. Higher-timeframe continuity (HTF filter)

At the setup bar close, compute the current higher-timeframe candle color from
fixed blocks of execution bars:

- H1 execution: 4 bars (H4) and 24 bars (D1)
- H4 execution: 6 bars (D1) and 30 bars (W1)
- D1 execution: 5 bars (W1) and 21 bars (M1)

A block is bullish if its current close > its opening price, bearish if the
reverse, flat otherwise. When bar timestamps are valid (Yahoo D1), the two HTFs
are calendar-aligned weeks and months; otherwise fixed blocks are used, which is
an approximation for FX session and holiday calendars.

Modes:

- `continuity`: long only if both HTFs are up; short only if both are down.
- `reversal`: long only if both HTFs are down; short only if both are up.
- `all`: ignore HTF.
- `none`: same as all (alias).

If the two HTFs conflict or one is flat, continuity/reversal modes skip the
setup.

## 4. Entry

At bar `i` (the bar after setup `s`), place OCO breakout orders at
`s.high` / `s.low`.

- `intrabar` (default): fill at `max(open, s.high)` for long or
  `min(open, s.low)` for short when the bar trades through the level.
- `close`: fill at the close of `i` only if the close is beyond the trigger.

If both trigger levels are touched in the same bar, the trade is skipped
(ambiguous intrabar path).

## 5. Stop and target

- Stop: setup bar low (long) or high (short).
- Risk `R = |entry - stop|`.
- Target `structural` (default): prior swing high/low over the last 20 bars
  before the setup bar. If that target is less than 0.5R away, use a 2R target.
- Target `2r`: entry +/- 2R.

Exits are checked conservatively:

- Stop is checked before target if both are touched in the same bar.
- Gap through stop/target fills at the open.
- Time exit after `max-hold` bars (default 24 H1 / 12 H4 / 10 D1).
- A target print on the same bar as an intrabar entry is not credited; the trade
  is managed from the next bar because the trigger/target ordering is unknown.

## 6. Costs and sizing

- Spread from the data file, half applied at entry and half at exit.
- Commission 0.5 bp and slippage 0.5 bp per side by default; configurable.
- Swap/financing: rate-based carry (base 3m rate minus quote 3m rate, previous
  month) when valid timestamps exist, plus a 0.2 bp/day swap spread. Feeds
  without valid dates fall back to a flat 0.2 bp/day financing cost.
- Risk 1% of equity per trade. Equity is compounded per trade by
  `1 + risk * netR`.

## 7. Known limitations

- Entry and target rules are mechanical interpretations of discretionary Strat
  guidance.
- Stop/target intrabar ordering is assumed (stop first), not modeled from ticks.
- HTF grouping uses calendar weeks/months when timestamps are valid; otherwise
  fixed bar blocks are used.
- No session filter, news filter, partials, trailing, pyramiding, or portfolio
  risk limits.
- Broker-feed validation is still pending.
- A date-based walk-forward was run, but the rule is not validated; see README.
  Treat this as a research harness, not a validated strategy.
